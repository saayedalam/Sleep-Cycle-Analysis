    "### üß™ A/B Test Scenarios for Sleep Cycle Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are five A/B test ideas derived from the cleaned sleep dataset. Each test explores how a specific factor might influence sleep-related outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. üå°Ô∏è Effect of Weather Type on Sleep Quality  \n",
    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: There is no difference in average sleep quality between \"No weather\" and known weather types  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: Sleep quality differs when a weather condition is recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups:**  \n",
    "- A = Weather type is `\"No weather\"`  \n",
    "- B = Weather type is any other known condition\n",

    "**Metric:**  \n",
    "- `Sleep Quality`\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. üèôÔ∏è Effect of City on Nighttime Movement  \n",
    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: City has no effect on movements per hour during sleep  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: Movement varies by city\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups:**  \n",
    "- A = City A (e.g., Toronto)  \n",
    "- B = City B (e.g., Dhaka)\n",

    "#### 3. üîÅ Effect of Sleep Regularity on Time to Fall Asleep  \n",
    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: There is no difference in time before sleep between irregular and regular sleepers  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: Regular sleepers fall asleep faster\n",

    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: Step count has no impact on sleep quality  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: People who walk more sleep better\n",
    "\n",

    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: Temperature has no impact on time spent in bed  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: People stay in bed longer when it‚Äôs colder\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups:**  \n",
    "- A = Weather temperature < 50¬∞F  \n",
    "- B = Weather temperature ‚â• 50¬∞F\n",
