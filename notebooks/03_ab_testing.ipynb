    "### üß™ A/B Test Scenarios for Sleep Cycle Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are five A/B test ideas derived from the cleaned sleep dataset. Each test explores how a specific factor might influence sleep-related outcomes.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. üå°Ô∏è Effect of Weather Type on Sleep Quality  \n",
    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: There is no difference in average sleep quality between \"No weather\" and known weather types  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: Sleep quality differs when a weather condition is recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups:**  \n",
    "- A = Weather type is `\"No weather\"`  \n",
    "- B = Weather type is any other known condition\n",

    "#### 2. üèôÔ∏è Effect of City on Nighttime Movement  \n",
    "**Hypothesis:**  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: City has no effect on movements per hour during sleep  \n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: Movement varies by city\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Define Objective**  \n",
    "   - What are you testing?  \n",

    "   - Import dataset.  \n",
    "   - Parse datetime columns if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clean Data**  \n",
    "   - Fix missing values, data types, and units (e.g., seconds ‚Üí hours).  \n",
    "   - Drop irrelevant or unreliable columns.\n",
